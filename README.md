## First HTML-CSS Assignment

This assignment is done to test us of our knowledge of week 1's lessons; We are to to be tested in checking a website's "Accessibility"
-Given the Acceptance criteria:
  We are to view the source code, HTML Elements, Image elements, alt attributes, heading attributes, and title element
  Then we are to make sure that the elements are in Semantic Order and follows a logical structure indepent of styling and positioning
  Also that the elements follow a sequential order

What I have done is to first go line by line in both CSS and HTML
I removed unneccessary elements such as the color for:
  .header h1 .seo {
    color: #d9dcd6;
Since i found it somewhat unnecessary since the color has been created under this class:
  .header 

I also grouped multiple elements together with under the same name 
i.e

I have commented as well my thought process in the CSS file as to why I didn't group all the elements together even though they have the same CSS property
